    """Compute visible tiles from (ox, oy) with Euclidean clamp and strict corner rules.

    Visibility rules:
      1) Euclidean radius clamp for LOS **tiles themselves** (the set we consider).
      2) Bresenham line-of-sight marching with **strict diagonal-corner blocking**:
         - When the ray takes a diagonal step from (prev_x, prev_y) to (x, y),
           visibility is blocked if either of the two orthogonal neighbors
           `(prev_x, y)` or `(x, prev_y)` is opaque.
      3) The **first blocking wall** encountered along a ray is revealed, then tracing stops.
      4) Corridor-wall reveal (unbounded): for every visible **floor** tile, reveal any
         **orthogonally adjacent** wall tiles, even if those lie outside the radius.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid
        2D rectangular grid indexed as `grid[y][x]` whose cells expose `.opaque: bool`.
        Out-of-bounds is treated as opaque.
    ox, oy
        Origin x/y in grid coordinates.
    radius
        Euclidean radius used to limit which target tiles we attempt LOS against.

    Returns
    -------
    Set[Point]
        Set of visible points `(x, y)` using `core.types.Point`.

    Complexity
    ----------
    Let WÃ—H be the map size and R the radius. The first pass visits O(R^2) targets and
    marches a Bresenham line for each (worst-case O(R)), so O(R^3) in the worst case.
    The corridor-wall pass is O(|vis|). In practice R is small enough that this is
    fast for roguelike FOV.
